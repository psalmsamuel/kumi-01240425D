**Electrical Appliance Load Monitoring**
Project Overview

The Electrical Appliance Load Monitoring system is a C++ console-based application developed to monitor electrical appliance usage, calculate daily energy consumption, and generate electricity billing reports.

The program allows users to register appliances, store appliance data persistently using text files, compute daily energy usage, and generate billing reports based on a user-defined electricity tariff.

This project demonstrates structured programming, file handling, input validation, and modular design in C++.
Features
1. Appliance Registration

Users can register appliances by entering:

    Appliance name
    Power rating (Watts)
    Usage hours per day

Input validation ensures:

    Appliance name is not empty
    Power rating is positive
    Usage hours are between 0 and 24

2. View Appliances

Displays all registered appliances in a formatted table including:

    Appliance name
    Power rating
    Usage hours per day
    Daily energy consumption (kWh/day)

3. Energy Calculation

Daily energy consumption is calculated using:

Energy (kWh/day) = (Power × Hours) / 1000

The system calculates:

    Individual appliance daily energy
    Total daily energy consumption

4. Persistent Data Storage

Appliance records are saved automatically to:

appliances.txt

When the program starts, previously saved appliance data is loaded automatically.

Data format used:

Name|Watts|Hours|Energy

Example:

Fan|50|5
TV|25|6
Iron|15|3
5. Billing Report Generation

The user enters an electricity tariff (cost per kWh).

The system calculates:

    Individual appliance daily energy
    Individual appliance daily cost
    Total daily energy consumption
    Total daily cost
    Monthly energy (30 days)
    Monthly cost (30 days)

The billing report is displayed on the console and automatically saved to:

billing_summary.txt
Concepts Applied

    Structs for modeling appliance data
    Vectors for dynamic storage
    Modular programming using separate functions
    File handling using <fstream>
    File parsing using <sstream>
    Input validation using cin.fail()
    Formatted output using <iomanip>
    Basic string manipulation and trimming

Conclusion

This project simulates a real-world electrical energy monitoring and billing system. It demonstrates the practical application of C++ programming concepts including data structures, file persistence, modular design, and cost calculation based on energy consumption.
